# SQL filter pattern for development environment dashboards
# This filter is applied to the WHERE clause in SQL queries to prevent 
# production users from appearing in development dashboards
DEV_FILTER_PATTERN=username <> 'Sophieb' AND username <> 'Gaju'

# SQL filter pattern for production environment dashboards
# This filter ensures only production users appear in production dashboards
PROD_FILTER_PATTERN=username = 'Sophieb' OR username = 'Gaju'

# Legacy username pattern filters (these are being replaced by the FILTER_PATTERN variables)
# SQL pattern for filtering development usernames (e.g., "'dev_%'" to show only users with 'dev_' prefix)
# DEV_USERNAME_PATTERN='dev_%'

# SQL pattern for filtering production usernames (e.g., "'prod_%'" to show only users with 'prod_' prefix)
# PROD_USERNAME_PATTERN='prod_%'
